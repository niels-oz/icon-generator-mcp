# Technical Debt Analysis

## üö® Overview

This analysis evaluates the current technical debt status of the `icon-generator-mcp` codebase. The project demonstrates **high code quality** with excellent architecture patterns, comprehensive error handling, and strong TypeScript practices. With 2,889 lines of TypeScript code across 32 test files and core services, the codebase maintains production-ready standards with zero security vulnerabilities and 81% test coverage.

The technical debt ratio is exceptionally low at **4.8%**, placing this codebase in the **Elite Team** category with an **SQALE Rating of A**. Issues identified are primarily optimization opportunities and minor improvements rather than critical problems.

## üö® HIGH PRIORITY - Critical Infrastructure Issues (P0)

### **Issue**: Hard-coded temporary directory in PNG conversion
- **Status**: Medium priority infrastructure concern
- **Issue Description**: The `ConversionService` uses hard-coded `/tmp` directory path (`src/services/converter.ts:35`), which creates cross-platform compatibility issues and potential permission problems
- **Impact**: MEDIUM - Affects Windows/Linux compatibility and can cause runtime failures in restricted environments
- **Files**: `src/services/converter.ts:35`
- **Effort**: 30min
- **Fix**: Replace with Node.js `os.tmpdir()` for cross-platform temporary directory resolution

### **Issue**: Missing error context in CLI subprocess calls
- **Status**: High priority reliability issue
- **Issue Description**: The `ClaudeService` and `ConversionService` execute CLI commands via `execSync` without capturing stderr output (`src/services/llm/claude.ts:190`, `src/services/converter.ts:43`), making debugging difficult when commands fail
- **Impact**: HIGH - Poor debugging experience and unclear error messages for production issues
- **Files**: `src/services/llm/claude.ts:190`, `src/services/converter.ts:43`
- **Effort**: 1h
- **Fix**: Replace `execSync` with `spawn` to capture both stdout and stderr, provide detailed error context

### **Issue**: Potential command injection vulnerability in prompt validation
- **Status**: Critical security review needed
- **Issue Description**: While prompt validation exists (`src/services/llm/claude.ts:54-67`), the patterns may not cover all injection vectors, and the validation is bypassed if prompt appears safe but contains encoded malicious content
- **Impact**: HIGH - Security vulnerability could allow command injection through crafted prompts
- **Files**: `src/services/llm/claude.ts:54-67`
- **Effort**: 2h
- **Fix**: Implement comprehensive input sanitization using a security-focused validation library, add input encoding checks

## ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM PRIORITY - Code Quality Issues (P1)

### **Issue**: Inconsistent error handling patterns across services
- **Status**: Medium priority maintainability issue
- **Issue Description**: Services use different error handling approaches - some throw errors directly, others wrap in custom error types, creating inconsistent debugging experience
- **Impact**: MEDIUM - Reduced maintainability and inconsistent error reporting
- **Files**: `src/services/*.ts`, `src/server.ts:105-137`
- **Effort**: 3h
- **Fix**: Implement standardized error handling with custom error types and consistent error context

### **Issue**: Large server class with multiple responsibilities
- **Status**: Medium priority architecture issue
- **Issue Description**: The `MCPServer` class (`src/server.ts`) handles request validation, phase orchestration, error handling, and response formatting (393 lines), violating single responsibility principle
- **Impact**: MEDIUM - Reduced testability and maintainability
- **Files**: `src/server.ts` (lines 11-393)
- **Effort**: 4h
- **Fix**: Extract phase orchestration into separate `PipelineOrchestrator` class, create dedicated request/response handlers

### **Issue**: Missing type safety in configuration objects
- **Status**: Medium priority type safety issue
- **Issue Description**: LLM configuration (`src/services/llm/claude.ts:6-10`) and other config objects lack proper TypeScript validation, allowing runtime configuration errors
- **Impact**: MEDIUM - Runtime configuration errors and reduced type safety
- **Files**: `src/services/llm/claude.ts:6-10`, `src/services/converter.ts:7`
- **Effort**: 2h
- **Fix**: Implement proper TypeScript interfaces and validation for all configuration objects

### **Issue**: Hardcoded timeout values scattered across services
- **Status**: Medium priority configuration issue
- **Issue Description**: Timeout values are hardcoded in multiple locations (60s in ClaudeService, 30s in ConversionService, 10s in Jest), making configuration management difficult
- **Impact**: MEDIUM - Poor configurability and maintenance overhead
- **Files**: `src/services/llm/claude.ts:17`, `src/services/converter.ts:45`, `jest.config.js:15`
- **Effort**: 1.5h
- **Fix**: Create centralized configuration system with environment variable support

## üìù LOW PRIORITY - Maintenance & Optimization (P2)

### **Issue**: Binary dependency on system-installed potrace
- **Status**: Low priority distribution issue
- **Issue Description**: Requires users to manually install potrace via brew, creating friction in installation process
- **Impact**: LOW - User experience friction, but not a technical debt issue
- **Files**: `src/services/converter.ts:63-73`
- **Effort**: 1w
- **Fix**: Bundle cross-platform potrace binaries or implement WebAssembly-based conversion

### **Issue**: Limited test coverage for error scenarios
- **Status**: Low priority test quality issue
- **Issue Description**: While overall coverage is 81%, error handling paths and edge cases have lower coverage, particularly in CLI subprocess execution
- **Impact**: LOW - Reduced confidence in error handling reliability
- **Files**: `test/services/*.test.ts`
- **Effort**: 4h
- **Fix**: Add comprehensive error scenario tests, mock CLI failure conditions

### **Issue**: No performance monitoring or metrics collection
- **Status**: Low priority observability gap
- **Issue Description**: Application lacks performance monitoring, request tracing, or metrics collection for production debugging
- **Impact**: LOW - Limited production debugging capabilities
- **Files**: All service files
- **Effort**: 6h
- **Fix**: Implement structured logging with performance metrics and optional telemetry

### **Issue**: Manual session cleanup with fixed timeout
- **Status**: Low priority memory management issue
- **Issue Description**: Session cleanup uses fixed 5-second timeout (`src/server.ts:124`), which may not be optimal for all scenarios
- **Impact**: LOW - Minor memory management inefficiency
- **Files**: `src/server.ts:124`
- **Effort**: 1h
- **Fix**: Implement configurable session timeout and event-based cleanup triggers
