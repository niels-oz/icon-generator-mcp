# Future Iterations Backlog

This document contains features and enhancements that were identified during requirements gathering but deferred to future releases to maintain focus on the core MCP server enhancement.

## Phase 2 Enhancements

### Dynamic Tool Loading System
- **Description**: Plugin system where users can add custom tools by placing files in a `/tools` directory
- **Value**: Enhances extensibility and allows user customization without modifying core server code
- **Complexity**: Medium - requires tool discovery, validation, and dynamic loading mechanisms

### Structured Logging Integration
- **Description**: Integrate Winston or Pino for production-grade logging with different log levels
- **Value**: Better diagnostics, debugging capabilities, and production monitoring
- **Complexity**: Low - standard logging library integration

### Multi-platform Support
- **Description**: Extend support beyond macOS to include Windows and Linux platforms
- **Value**: Broader user base and market reach
- **Complexity**: High - requires platform-specific testing, dependency management, and binary compatibility

### Real-time Progress Updates
- **Description**: Provide WebSocket or Server-Sent Events for real-time generation progress updates
- **Value**: Enhanced user experience with live feedback during icon generation
- **Complexity**: Medium - requires WebSocket implementation and client-side integration

### Bundled Binary Distribution
- **Description**: Bundle Potrace binary with npm package to eliminate `brew install potrace` requirement
- **Value**: Simplified installation, better user experience, reduced setup friction
- **Complexity**: High - cross-platform binary management, licensing considerations, package size impact

## Phase 3 Enhancements

### Additional Input Formats
- **Description**: Support for JPEG, GIF, WebP input formats beyond current PNG/SVG support
- **Value**: More flexible input options for users with different image formats
- **Complexity**: Medium - requires additional conversion pipelines and format validation

### Batch Processing Capabilities
- **Description**: Process multiple icons in a single request for efficiency
- **Value**: Improved workflow for users generating multiple related icons
- **Complexity**: Medium - requires request batching, parallel processing, and result aggregation

### Advanced Conversion Parameters
- **Description**: Expose Potrace parameters for fine-tuning conversion quality and style
- **Value**: Professional users can optimize conversion for specific use cases
- **Complexity**: Low - parameter pass-through to Potrace with validation

### Plugin Architecture
- **Description**: Comprehensive plugin system for extending server capabilities
- **Value**: Third-party integrations, custom workflows, community contributions
- **Complexity**: High - requires plugin API design, security sandboxing, and lifecycle management

### Performance Optimizations
- **Description**: Caching, parallel processing, and memory optimization improvements
- **Value**: Faster generation times, better resource utilization, scalability
- **Complexity**: Medium - requires profiling, optimization implementation, and testing

## Evaluation Criteria

When considering these features for future implementation:

1. **User Demand**: Features should address real user needs and requests
2. **Complexity vs Value**: Balance implementation effort against user benefit
3. **Maintenance Burden**: Consider long-term support and maintenance requirements
4. **Platform Compatibility**: Ensure features work across supported platforms
5. **Security Impact**: Evaluate security implications of new features
6. **Performance Impact**: Assess effect on core functionality performance

## Implementation Priority

**High Priority** (Phase 2):
- Bundled Binary Distribution (eliminates major user friction)
- Multi-platform Support (expands user base)

**Medium Priority** (Phase 2-3):
- Dynamic Tool Loading System (extensibility)
- Real-time Progress Updates (UX improvement)
- Batch Processing Capabilities (efficiency)

**Low Priority** (Phase 3+):
- Structured Logging Integration (operational improvement)
- Additional Input Formats (nice-to-have)
- Advanced Conversion Parameters (power user feature)
- Plugin Architecture (complex, long-term)
- Performance Optimizations (as needed)
