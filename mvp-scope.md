### 1. Project Goal

To create a command-line utility that enables designers and developers to generate a new SVG icon based on a set of reference PNG images and a text prompt. The tool will leverage the Anthropic Claude LLM as its generative engine, orchestrating a local data pipeline before delegating the AI task.

### 2. MVP: In-Scope Features

The following features and characteristics define the mandatory scope for the initial release:

*   **Core Functionality:** The tool will perform a single, end-to-end generation per invocation, creating one new SVG icon.
*   **Input Format:** The tool will exclusively support PNG files as image inputs.
*   **Platform Support:** The MVP will be officially developed for and supported on **macOS only** (both Apple Silicon and Intel architectures).
*   **LLM Provider:** The tool will exclusively use the **Anthropic Claude** model family as its generative engine.
*   **LLM Interaction:** The tool will interact with Claude by invoking the official `@anthropic-ai/claude` CLI tool as a subprocess. It will not handle API keys or authentication tokens directly.
*   **Vectorization Engine:** The tool will bundle a pre-compiled `potrace` binary for macOS to handle the PNG-to-SVG vectorization process. This ensures a zero-dependency setup for this critical step.
*   **Image Pre-processing:** Any necessary image manipulation (e.g., converting PNG to the BMP format required by Potrace) will be handled by a pure JavaScript library (`jimp`) to avoid system-level dependencies like ImageMagick.
*   **Installation:** The tool must be installable as a global package via a standard npm command (`npm install -g`).
*   **User Interface:** The tool will be a non-interactive CLI. All parameters must be provided via command-line arguments and flags at invocation.
*   **CLI Output:** The CLI output will be functional and text-based, without rich visual elements such as progress spinners or colored text.
*   **Configuration:** All configuration will be provided via command-line arguments at runtime. Project-level configuration files are not supported.

### 3. MVP: Out-of-Scope (Future Iterations)

The following items are explicitly excluded from the MVP but are recognized as valuable potential enhancements for future versions:

*   **Expanded Platform Support:** Providing pre-compiled binaries and official support for Windows and Linux.
*   **Expanded Image Support:** Support for other input formats like JPEG, GIF, and WebP.
*   **Multi-Generation:** The ability to generate multiple design variations from a single prompt (e.g., via a `--count=3` flag).
*   **Interactive Mode:** An interactive "wizard" mode to guide users through the generation process.
*   **Advanced Conversion Tuning:** Exposing advanced Potrace parameters (e.g., `--turdsize`, `--alphamax`) to the user via CLI flags.
*   **Multi-LLM Support:** Integrating other LLM providers like OpenAI (GPT series) or Google (Gemini).
*   **Direct API Key Authentication:** Allowing users to provide an API key directly via an environment variable, bypassing the dependency on the Claude CLI.
*   **Enhanced CLI UX:** Adding rich feedback elements like progress spinners, color-coded output, and structured tables.
*   **Configuration Files:** Support for a project-level configuration file (e.g., `.icon-generator-rc`) for default settings.
*   **Plugin Architecture:** Designing a formal plugin system for custom conversion engines or prompt strategies.
*   **Usage Analytics:** Adding opt-in, anonymous usage telemetry for product improvement.
